    Hi! Have you ever thought about the history of Origami ? I think it might be interesting to 
    about history of Origami before learning it .
    WHAT IS ORIGAMI?
    Origami is the art of paper-folding. Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) 
    and kami("paper").Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper
    (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.

    Creatives from several countries helped shape origami into the practice it is today.

    Many studies assert that origami was invented by the Japanese about a thousand years ago, but its roots may well be in China. 
    By the Edo period (1603–1868), paper folding in Japan had become recreational as well as ceremonial, often featuring multiple cuts and folds. It came to be regarded as a new form of art that was enabled by the advent of paper both mass-produced and more affordable. 
    Traditional origami is characterized by open-access folding patterns and sequences passed down orally or anonymously from generation to generation. Modern origami often features models created by designers. Many of these models are considered copyrightable material or intellectual property. Modern origami often prioritizes a puzzle aspect to the folding, and the challenge of folding a single square of paper without using cuts or glue.
    Fun Fact
Although origami is typically associated with Japan, paper folding became popular in Europe, too.
 In Spain, the practice is called papiroflexia or pajarita.
